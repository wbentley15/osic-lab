aodh_db_port: 27017

## Glance Options
# Set glance_default_store to "swift" if using Cloud Files or swift backend
# or "rbd" if using ceph backend; the latter will trigger ceph to get
# installed on glance
glance_default_store: file
glance_notification_driver: noop

# `internalURL` will cause glance to speak to swift via ServiceNet, use
# `publicURL` to communicate with swift over the public network
glance_swift_store_endpoint_type: internalURL

# Ceph client user for glance to connect to the ceph cluster
#glance_ceph_client: glance
# Ceph pool name for Glance to use
#glance_rbd_store_pool: images
#glance_rbd_store_chunk_size: 8

## Nova
# When nova_libvirt_images_rbd_pool is defined, ceph will be installed on nova
# hosts.
#nova_libvirt_images_rbd_pool: vms
# by default we assume you use rbd for both cinder and nova, and as libvirt
# needs to access both volumes (cinder) and boot disks (nova) we default to
# reuse the cinder_ceph_client
# only need to change this if you'd use ceph for boot disks and not for volumes
#nova_ceph_client:
#nova_ceph_client_uuid:

# This defaults to KVM, if you are deploying on a host that is not KVM capable
# change this to your hypervisor type: IE "qemu", "lxc".
# nova_virt_type: qemu
nova_cpu_allocation_ratio: 3.0
# nova_ram_allocation_ratio: 1.0

# If you wish to change the dhcp_domain configured for both nova and neutron
# dhcp_domain:

## Glance with Swift
### Extra options when configuring swift as a glance back-end.
### By default it will use the local swift install
### Set these when using a remote swift as a glance backend
#glance_swift_store_auth_address: "https://some.auth.url.com"
#glance_swift_store_user: "OPENSTACK_TENANT_ID:OPENSTACK_USER_NAME"

#cinder_ceph_client: cinder

## Ceph
# Enable these if you use ceph rbd for at least one component (glance, cinder, nova)
#ceph_apt_repo_url_region: "www"  # or "eu" for Netherlands based mirror
#ceph_stable_release: hammer
# Ceph Authentication - by default cephx is true
#cephx: true
# Ceph Monitors
# A list of the IP addresses for your Ceph monitors
#ceph_mons:
#  - 10.16.5.40
#  - 10.16.5.41
#  - 10.16.5.42
# Custom Ceph Configuration File (ceph.conf)
# By default, your deployment host will connect to one of the mons defined above to
# obtain a copy of your cluster's ceph.conf.  If you prefer, uncomment ceph_conf_file
# and customise to avoid ceph.conf being copied from a mon.
#ceph_conf_file: |
#  [global]
#  fsid = 00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444

#  mon_host = 10.16.5.40,10.16.5.41,10.16.5.42
#  # optionally, you can use this construct to avoid defining this list twice:
#  auth_cluster_required = cephx
#  auth_service_required = cephx


## SSL Settings
# Adjust these settings to change how SSL connectivity is configured for
# various services.  For more information, see the openstack-ansible
# documentation section titled "Securing services with SSL certificates".
#
## SSL: Keystone
# These do not need to be configured unless you're creating certificates for
# services running behind Apache (currently, Horizon and Keystone).
ssl_protocol: "ALL -SSLv2 -SSLv3"
# Cipher suite string from https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/
ssl_cipher_suite: "ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS"
# To override for Keystone only:
#   - keystone_ssl_protocol
#   - keystone_ssl_cipher_suite
# To override for Horizon only:
#   - horizon_ssl_protocol
#   - horizon_ssl_cipher_suite
#
## SSL: RabbitMQ
# Set these variables if you prefer to use existing SSL certificates, keys and
# CA certificates with the RabbitMQ SSL/TLS Listener
#
#rabbitmq_user_ssl_cert: <path to cert on ansible deployment host>
#rabbitmq_user_ssl_key: <path to cert on ansible deployment host>
#rabbitmq_user_ssl_ca_cert: <path to cert on ansible deployment host>

## Additional pinning generator that will allow for more packages to be pinned as you see fit.
## All pins allow for package and versions to be defined. Be careful using this as versions
## are always subject to change and updates regarding security will become your problem from this
## point on. Pinning can be done based on a package version, release, or origin. Use "*" in the
## package name to indicate that you want to pin all package to a particular constraint.
# apt_pinned_packages:
#   - { package: "lxc", version: "1.0.7-0ubuntu0.1" }
#   - { package: "libvirt-bin", version: "1.2.2-0ubuntu13.1.9" }
#   - { package: "rabbitmq-server", origin: "www.rabbitmq.com" }
#   - { package: "*", release: "MariaDB" }


## Environment variable settings
# This allows users to specify the additional environment variables to be set
# which is useful in setting where you working behind a proxy. If working behind
# a proxy It's important to always specify the scheme as "http://". This is what
# the underlying python libraries will handle best. This proxy information will be
# placed both on the hosts and inside the containers.

## SSH connection wait time
# If an increased delay for the ssh connection check is desired,
# uncomment this variable and set it appropriately.
#ssh_delay: 5

## HAProxy
# Uncomment this to disable keepalived installation (cf. documentation)
# haproxy_use_keepalived: False
#
# HAProxy Keepalived configuration (cf. documentation)
# Make sure that this is set correctly according to the CIDR used for your
# internal and external addresses.
# haproxy_keepalived_external_vip_cidr: "{{external_lb_vip_address}}/32"
haproxy_keepalived_internal_vip_cidr: "{{internal_lb_vip_address}}/32"
# haproxy_keepalived_external_interface: br-mgmt
haproxy_keepalived_internal_interface: br-mgmt

# Defines the default VRRP id used for keepalived with haproxy.
# Overwrite it to your value to make sure you don't overlap
# with existing VRRPs id on your network. Default is 10 for the external and 11 for the
# internal VRRPs
# haproxy_keepalived_external_virtual_router_id: 50
# haproxy_keepalived_internal_virtual_router_id: 51

# Defines the VRRP master/backup priority. Defaults respectively to 100 and 20
# haproxy_keepalived_priority_master:
# haproxy_keepalived_priority_backup:

# Keepalived default IP address used to check its alive status (IPv4 only)
keepalived_ping_address: "172.22.20.116"

# All the previous variables are used in a var file, fed to the keepalived role.
# To use another file to feed the role, override the following var:
# haproxy_keepalived_vars_file: 'vars/configs/keepalived_haproxy.yml'

## Host security hardening
# The openstack-ansible-security role provides security hardening for hosts
# by applying security configurations from the STIG. Hardening is disabled by
# default, but an option to opt-in is available by setting the following
# variable to 'true'.
# Docs: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/
# apply_security_hardening: true
apply_security_hardening: false
